This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating a common off-by-one error in array iteration. The program attempts to calculate the sum of elements in an array, but due to an incorrect loop condition, it accesses an index beyond the array bounds, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate through the array to avoid this error.
